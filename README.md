  <p>A detailed wooden toy ship with intricately carved masts and sails is seen gliding smoothly over a plush, blue carpet that mimics the waves of the sea. The ship's hull is painted a rich brown, with tiny windows. The carpet, soft and textured, provides a perfect backdrop, resembling an oceanic expanse. Surrounding the ship are various other toys and children's items, hinting at a playful environment. The scene captures the innocence and imagination of childhood, with the toy ship's journey symbolizing endless adventures in a whimsical, indoor setting.</p>

  <p>The camera follows behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road surrounded by pine trees on a steep mountain slope, dust kicks up from its tires, the sunlight shines on the SUV as it speeds along the dirt road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The dirt road curves gently into the distance, with no other cars or vehicles in sight. The trees on either side of the road are redwoods, with patches of greenery scattered throughout. The car is seen from the rear following the curve with ease, making it seem as if it is on a rugged drive through the rugged terrain. The dirt road itself is surrounded by steep hills and mountains, with a clear blue sky above with wispy clouds.</p>

  <p>In the haunting backdrop of a war-torn city, where ruins and crumbled walls tell a story of devastation, a poignant close-up frames a young girl. Her face is smudged with ash, a silent testament to the chaos around her. Her eyes glistening with a mix of sorrow and resilience, capturing the raw emotion of a world that has lost its innocence to the ravages of conflict.</p>

## Model Introduction

CogVideoX is an open-source version of the video generation model, which is homologous
to [Ê∏ÖÂΩ±](https://chatglm.cn/video).

## Project Structure

This open-source repository will guide developers to quickly get started with the basic usage and fine-tuning examples
of the **CogVideoX** open-source model.

### Inference

+ [cli_demo](inference/cli_demo.py): A more detailed explanation of the inference code, mentioning the significance of
  common parameters.
+ [cli_vae_demo](inference/cli_vae_demo.py): Executing the VAE inference code alone currently requires 71GB of memory,
  but it will be optimized in the future.
+ [convert_demo](inference/converter_demo.py): How to convert user input into a format suitable for CogVideoX.
+ [web_demo](inference/web_demo.py): A simple streamlit web application demonstrating how to use the CogVideoX-2B model
  to generate videos.

    <img src="resources/web_demo.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</div>

### sat

+ [sat_demo](sat/README.md): Contains the inference code and fine-tuning code of SAT weights. It is
  recommended to improve based on the CogVideoX model structure. Innovative researchers use this code to better perform
  rapid stacking and development.

### Tools

This folder contains some tools for model conversion / caption generation, etc.

+ [convert_weight_sat2hf](tools/convert_weight_sat2hf.py): Convert SAT model weights to Huggingface model weights.
+ [caption_demo](tools/caption_demo.py): Caption tool, a model that understands videos and outputs them in text.
