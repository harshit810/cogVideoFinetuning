## Update and News

- üî• **News**: ```2024/8/7```: CogVideoX has been integrated into `diffusers` version 0.30.0. Inference can now be
  performed
  on a single 3090 GPU. For more details, please refer to the [code](inference/cli_demo.py).
- üî• **News**: ```2024/8/6```: We have also open-sourced **3D Causal VAE** used in **CogVideoX-2B**, which can
  reconstruct
  the video almost losslessly.
- üî• **News**: ```2024/8/6```: We have open-sourced **CogVideoX-2B**Ôºåthe first model in the CogVideoX series of video
  generation models.
- üå± **Source**: ```2022/5/19```: We have open-sourced **CogVideo** (now you can see in `CogVideo` branch)Ôºåthe **first**
  open-sourced pretrained text-to-video model, and you can
  check [ICLR'23 CogVideo Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15868) for technical details.

**More powerful models with larger parameter sizes are on the way~ Stay tuned!**

## Quick Start

### Prompt Optimization

Before running the model, please refer to [this guide](inference/convert_demo.py) to see how we use large models like
GLM-4 (or other comparable products, such as GPT-4) to optimize the model. This is crucial because the model is trained
with long prompts, and a good prompt directly impacts the quality of the video generation.

### SAT

**Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12.**

Follow instructions in [sat_demo](sat/README.md): Contains the inference code and fine-tuning code of SAT weights. It is
recommended to improve based on the CogVideoX model structure. Innovative researchers use this code to better perform
rapid stacking and development.
(18 GB for inference, 40GB for lora finetune)

### Diffusers

**Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12.**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then follow [diffusers_demo](inference/cli_demo.py): A more detailed explanation of the inference code, mentioning the
significance of common parameters.
(24GB for inference,fine-tuned code are under development)

  <p>A detailed wooden toy ship with intricately carved masts and sails is seen gliding smoothly over a plush, blue carpet that mimics the waves of the sea. The ship's hull is painted a rich brown, with tiny windows. The carpet, soft and textured, provides a perfect backdrop, resembling an oceanic expanse. Surrounding the ship are various other toys and children's items, hinting at a playful environment. The scene captures the innocence and imagination of childhood, with the toy ship's journey symbolizing endless adventures in a whimsical, indoor setting.</p>

  <p>The camera follows behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road surrounded by pine trees on a steep mountain slope, dust kicks up from its tires, the sunlight shines on the SUV as it speeds along the dirt road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The dirt road curves gently into the distance, with no other cars or vehicles in sight. The trees on either side of the road are redwoods, with patches of greenery scattered throughout. The car is seen from the rear following the curve with ease, making it seem as if it is on a rugged drive through the rugged terrain. The dirt road itself is surrounded by steep hills and mountains, with a clear blue sky above with wispy clouds.</p>

## CogVideo(ICLR'23)

The official repo for the
paper: [CogVideo: Large-scale Pretraining for Text-to-Video Generation via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15868)
is on the [CogVideo branch](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo/tree/CogVideo)

**CogVideo is able to generate relatively high-frame-rate videos.**
A 4-second clip of 32 frames is shown below.
